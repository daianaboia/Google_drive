# Google_drive

This code allows you to load files on google drive, and then also downloading them.

pip install pydrive

You'll also need to have three more files:

- client_secrets.json: to allow the Python code to access Google Drive (more here:https://d35mpxyw7m7k7g.cloudfront.net/bigdata_1/Get+Authentication+for+Google+Service+API+.pdf)
- settings.yaml : to avoid inputting passwords (more here:https://d35mpxyw7m7k7g.cloudfront.net/bigdata_1/Get+Authentication+for+Google+Service+API+.pdf)
- credentials.json: originated from the settings.yaml, after entering credentials one more time Python will use that file to automate the autentification
